<p>To access our API help page please click here.</p>
<p>If you would like access to our API, please contact us and include the IP address from which you will be sending requests to our API.</p>
<p>Discovery holds more than 32 million descriptions of records held by The National Archives and more than 2,500 archives and institutions across the United Kingdom, as well as a smaller number of archives around the world.</p>
<p>The information in Discovery is made up of record descriptions provided by or derived from the catalogues of the different archives. Although some of The National Archives’ records have been digitised and can be read online, Discovery can’t search the words within them – only their description and title.</p>
<p>Our API allows developers to query the search engine and database within the Discovery service application programmatically, and returns results in XML or Json for further processing. The service is offered as a beta with some functionality still to be developed.</p>
<p>In the meantime we welcome feedback on the functionality in this release.</p>

<p>Our Discovery application programming interface (API) is designed to maximise access to the information held in our Discovery service catalogue.</p>
<p>You are welcome to use the information and the images for personal use, educational purposes or commercial use under the Open Government Licence.</p>
